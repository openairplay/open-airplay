open-airplay
============

A collection of libraries for Apple's AirPlay protocol. The Java library also requires [JMDNS](http://jmdns.sourceforge.net/) if you want to support searching/bonjour auto discovery.

Examples
========
The library can be used by another application, but it can also be used for some basic tasks from the command line or directly (by double clicking):

Build:
```
cd Java && ant
```
Send a photo:
```
php airplay.php -h hostname[:port] -p file
java -jar airplay.jar -h hostname[:port] [-a password] -p file
```
Stream desktop:
```
php airplay.php -h hostname[:port] -d (mac only)
java -jar airplay.jar -h hostname[:port] [-a password] -d
```

Stream desktop - GUI dialog for selecting available apple tvs (bonjour discovery) and resolution:
```
java -jar airplay.jar
```
